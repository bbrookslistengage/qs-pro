name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles, HTTP conventions, and proper resource naming. Use this skill when creating new API routes, modifying existing endpoints, working with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), setting up API versioning, implementing pagination or filtering, defining URL structures, returning HTTP status codes, or working with rate limiting. Apply when editing files like routes.ts, controllers, api/ directories, endpoint handlers, or any server-side code that handles HTTP requests and responses.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new API endpoints or routes
- When modifying existing HTTP route handlers
- When deciding between `AppError` and `HttpException` for errors
- When implementing error responses (use RFC 9457 Problem Details format)
- When working with RESTful resource design and URL structures
- When implementing pagination, filtering, sorting, or search query parameters
- When setting up or modifying API versioning strategies
- When defining HTTP status codes for API responses
- When working with rate limiting headers and configurations
- When editing files in routes/, controllers/, api/, or endpoints/ directories
- When working with files like routes.ts, router.ts, controller.ts, or handler.ts
- When designing nested resource URLs or parent-child relationships in APIs
